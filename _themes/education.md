description: Without a community of data consumers, or the support of data producers, open data won't become part of the national discourse. We want all South Africans to be able to take one or more datasets, understand their significance, and use that data for social change. Take a look at <a href="/tools/youthexplorer.html">Youth Explorer</a>. It profiles the situation of young people and the contexts in which they live. You can explore and download the data to see for yourself how much you can learn about South African youth using data.
